Hand Gesture Volume Control System
Overview
This Python script utilizes computer vision techniques to track hand gestures in real-time from a webcam feed. It detects specific hand gestures and maps them to control volume adjustments on the system.

Features
Detects hand gestures using the MediaPipe library.
Tracks the movement of thumb and index fingers to calculate the distance between them.
Adjusts system volume based on the distance between fingers.
Provides visual feedback by drawing landmarks and lines on the webcam feed.
Can be easily customized and integrated into existing applications.
Dependencies
OpenCV (cv2): A popular library for computer vision tasks.
MediaPipe (mediapipe): A framework by Google for building multimodal machine learning pipelines.
PyAutoGUI (pyautogui): A library for programmatically controlling the mouse and keyboard.
Usage
Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
Run the Python script hand_volume_control.py.

Position your hand in front of the webcam, making sure it's well-lit and visible.

Perform the following hand gestures:

Place your thumb and index finger closer together to decrease volume.
Spread your thumb and index finger farther apart to increase volume.
The system volume will be adjusted accordingly based on the detected hand gestures.
